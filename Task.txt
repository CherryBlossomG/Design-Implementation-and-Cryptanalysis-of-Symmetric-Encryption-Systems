**Task 1 (20 points): Symmetric Encryption and Cryptanalysis**

Your task is to write a Python program that implements an encryption and decryption system based on a symmetric cipher. In this system, Alice generates a random secret key and uses it to encrypt a message, which is then securely sent to Bob. Bob must be able to receive the encrypted message and correctly decrypt it using the shared key.

The plaintext message to be encrypted is a provided literary text beginning with “From fairest creatures we desire increase…” and continuing through the full passage given in the assignment description. After encryption, Bob receives the ciphered text and successfully reads the original message.

At the same time, an attacker named Oscar attempts to hack the encrypted message without knowing the secret key. Your task is to find and implement an appropriate method that allows Oscar to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext. In addition, Alice must repeat the communication process using either your native language or the German language, after which Bob again decrypts the message and Oscar performs the same hacking attempt.

As part of this task, you must create a Python program that generates a random key of suitable length for the chosen cryptographic system, implements encoder and decoder functions, encrypts and decrypts the given text, and saves both the encrypted and decrypted outputs into text files. You must also implement a hacking function that is able to recover the message using either a brute-force technique or an analysis-based cryptanalysis technique.

**Task 2 (20 points): AES Encryption System**

In this task, you are required to design and implement a more powerful encryption system using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 128-bit key. You must write a Python program that generates a random AES key and performs encryption and decryption strictly according to the AES specification.

The program should encrypt and decrypt the same plaintext message used in Task 1 and store the resulting ciphertext and decrypted plaintext in text files. No external AES, cryptography, or encryption libraries are allowed in this task; the AES algorithm must be implemented entirely from scratch in order to demonstrate a clear understanding of its internal structure and operations.

**Task 3 (5 points): OpenSSL Comparison**

In the final task, you are required to use OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt the same text file. The results obtained using OpenSSL should then be compared with those produced by your custom symmetric cipher and AES implementation. This comparison should highlight differences in correctness, security strength, and implementation complexity.
